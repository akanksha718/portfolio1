                <h4>The Art of Giving an Impressive Introduction</h4>
                <p>On first day we learnt that Your introduction is the gateway to how others perceive you, whether in a
                    professional meeting, a casual gathering, or even online. Mastering this skill can leave a lasting
                    impression and set the tone for any interaction.
                    and also various tips for a Impressive introduction
                </p>
                <p>1. Start with a Smile: A warm smile conveys confidence and friendliness. It puts you and your
                    audience at ease.</p>
                <p>2. Make Eye Contact: Eye contact shows that you are engaged and interested in the conversation. Avoid
                    staring but maintain a natural gaze.</p>
                <p>3. Keep It Concise: Your introduction should be brief, ideally under 30 seconds. Avoid unnecessary
                    details.</p>

                <h4>Movie review: Forest Grump </h4>
                <p>
                    I recently watched Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and it honestly left a strong
                    impression on me. As a student, especially someone still figuring out life, I found Forrest’s story
                    incredibly inspiring and emotional. The movie follows the life of Forrest Gump, a man with a low IQ
                    but a heart full of kindness and determination.<br>

                    What stood out to me most was how Forrest never lets his limitations define him. Despite being
                    different, he achieves amazing things — from becoming a college football star, serving in the
                    Vietnam War, starting a shrimp business, and even running across the country. His innocence and
                    honesty make him a character you can’t help but love. It taught me that you don’t have to be the
                    smartest person in the room to make a difference — you just have to keep moving forward, like he
                    says, "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."<br>

                    The way the movie ties Forrest’s life to real historical events was also really cool. As a student
                    learning about those events in history class, seeing Forrest interact with moments like meeting
                    presidents or being part of major movements made it more interesting and relatable.<br>

                    Overall, Forrest Gump is not just a great film — it’s a life lesson wrapped in an emotional, funny,
                    and unforgettable story. I would definitely recommend it to other students because it teaches
                    empathy, perseverance, and the importance of staying true to yourself

                <h4>Speech session:The Power of Empathy</h4>
                <p>



                    Good morning everyone,

                    Today, I want to talk about something that holds the power to transform our relationships, our
                    communities, and our world—empathy.<br>

                    Empathy is more than understanding another person's feelings; it is the ability to step into their
                    shoes, to see the world through their eyes, and to feel their emotions as if they were your own. In
                    a world that often feels divided, empathy is the bridge that connects us.<br>

                    Why is empathy so important? Because it is the foundation of human connection. It allows us to look
                    beyond our differences—of race, religion, gender, or background—and recognize the shared humanity
                    that unites us all. Empathy teaches us that behind every face is a story, behind every action is a
                    reason, and behind every struggle is a soul longing for understanding.<br>

                    Empathy is not a skill reserved for the kind-hearted or the compassionate. It is a choice we make
                    every day. When we choose to listen instead of judge, to understand instead of criticize, we create
                    an environment where people feel seen, valued, and loved.<br>

                    Imagine a world where leaders govern with empathy, where workplaces prioritize the well-being of
                    employees, and where neighbors genuinely care for one another. Such a world is not a utopia; it is a
                    possibility—if we all commit to cultivating empathy in our lives.<br>

                    But how do we practice empathy?<br>
                    First, listen—truly listen. Often, we hear to reply, not to understand.
                    Second, ask questions with the intent to learn, not to debate.
                    Third, be present. In our fast-paced world, giving someone your undivided attention is one of the
                    greatest acts of kindness.<br>

                    Empathy doesn’t just benefit others; it transforms us. It makes us more patient, more open-minded,
                    and more resilient. It reminds us that we are part of something greater than ourselves.<br>

                    In conclusion, empathy is not just an emotion; it is a force—a force that can heal wounds, mend
                    relationships, and build bridges. Let us choose empathy, not because it’s easy, but because it’s
                    necessary. Together, let us create a world where kindness and understanding triumph over division.

                    Thank you.</p>
