                <h4>The Art of Giving an Impressive Introduction</h4>
                <p>On first day we learnt that Your introduction is the gateway to how others perceive you, whether in a
                    professional meeting, a casual gathering, or even online. Mastering this skill can leave a lasting
                    impression and set the tone for any interaction.
                    and also various tips for a Impressive introduction
                </p>
                <p>1. Start with a Smile: A warm smile conveys confidence and friendliness. It puts you and your
                    audience at ease.</p>
                <p>2. Make Eye Contact: Eye contact shows that you are engaged and interested in the conversation. Avoid
                    staring but maintain a natural gaze.</p>
                <p>3. Keep It Concise: Your introduction should be brief, ideally under 30 seconds. Avoid unnecessary
                    details.</p>

                <h4>Movie review: Forest Grump </h4>
                <p>
                    I recently watched Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and it honestly left a strong
                    impression on me. As a student, especially someone still figuring out life, I found Forrest’s story
                    incredibly inspiring and emotional. The movie follows the life of Forrest Gump, a man with a low IQ
                    but a heart full of kindness and determination.<br>

                    What stood out to me most was how Forrest never lets his limitations define him. Despite being
                    different, he achieves amazing things — from becoming a college football star, serving in the
                    Vietnam War, starting a shrimp business, and even running across the country. His innocence and
                    honesty make him a character you can’t help but love. It taught me that you don’t have to be the
                    smartest person in the room to make a difference — you just have to keep moving forward, like he
                    says, "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."<br>

                    The way the movie ties Forrest’s life to real historical events was also really cool. As a student
                    learning about those events in history class, seeing Forrest interact with moments like meeting
                    presidents or being part of major movements made it more interesting and relatable.<br>

                    Overall, Forrest Gump is not just a great film — it’s a life lesson wrapped in an emotional, funny,
                    and unforgettable story. I would definitely recommend it to other students because it teaches
                    empathy, perseverance, and the importance of staying true to yourself
